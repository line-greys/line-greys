Hi, I’m @line-greys, a student at NYU Shanghai aiming to graduate in May 2023.

I like Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Video Games and Software Development in general.
I've done projects in Python, C++, C#, HTML and JavaScript.
Currently, I'm working on projects in C++ and Game Development in Unity.
I'd love to collaborate on anything you're excited about!
